Steps for Disparity extender:

1)  Get the LaserScan readings ###########
2)  Sweep it for the desired cone radius (< 180°) ##########
3)  During the sweep, check for disparities (sudden jump in distance, with threshold). ######
4)  When you encounter one, override the next "half_car_lenght" with the override value, jump to end+1 of disparity ##########
5)  Do this from left to right and from right to left ########
6)  Create a structure that contains gap info (gap center, gap depth) #######
7)  Sweep the modified LaserScan. #######
8)  Gather gap information with gap recognition algorithm ##########
9)  Decide wich gap is the deepest one ########
10) Check the scan < -90° and > 90°. If car distance to wall is < safety cornering threshold, disable steering 
11) Steer the car accordingly towards the center of said gap if possible
12) Regulate speed based on turning angle
